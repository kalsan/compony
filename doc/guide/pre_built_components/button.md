# Pre-built components: Button

As stated earlier, buttons are just regular components that rendered in-place. They don't make use of nesting logic (and presumably never will), and thus they are rendered as-is, without `sub_comp`.

You will rarely (or probably never) instantiate a button on your own, but use helpers like `Compony.button` or `compony_button`. For this reason, the documentation for instantiating buttons is located in the [section documenting helpers](/doc/guide/helpers.md).
